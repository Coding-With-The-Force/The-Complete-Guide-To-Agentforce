# The Complete Guide To Agentforce   

This repo houses a wiki that walks you through the important information to know when building with Salesforce's new Agentforce tool.
Throughout the wiki I try to explain the licenses required to actually run agentforce, the mandatory activation steps to setup agentforce in your org, the permissions required for a user to setup agentforce, the permissions required for a user to actually use an agentforce agent, and there are examples within the wiki of how to setup and use agents, agent actions, agent topics, prompt builder templates, data cloud, invocable apex actions, and more!
